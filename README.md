## Scenario
You are a sports data analyst and you have been tasked with summarizing data from the matches from a previous EuroCup. Your manager would like the following questions answered.
## Get the Data
data = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guipsamora/pandas_exercises/master/02_Filtering_%26_Sorting/Euro12/Euro_2012_stats_TEAM.csv', sep=',')
## Link to the Dataset
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guipsamora/pandas_exercises/master/02_Filtering_%26_Sorting/Euro12/Euro_2012_stats_TEAM.csv
## Questions
- How many teams participated in the Euro2012?
- What is the number of columns in the dataset?
- View only the columns Team, Yellow Cards and Red Cards and assign them to a dataframe called discipline.
- Sort the teams by Red Cards, then to Yellow Cards.
- Calculate the mean Yellow Cards given per Team.
- Filter teams that scored more than 6 goals.
- Select the teams that start with the letter G.
- Select the first 7 columns.
- Select all columns except the last 3.
- Present only the Shooting Accuracy from England, Italy and Russia.
## Data Analysis Workflow
- **Data Extraction:** Code snippets for extracting sales data from Euro Cup Soccer databases or other relevant sources, specifically focused on data extraction related to match statistics, player performance, or team standings.

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Scripts and notebooks designed for cleaning and preprocessing raw Euro Cup Soccer data, ensuring it is ready for analysis.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Jupyter notebooks dedicated to conducting exploratory data analysis on the Euro Cup Soccer data, aiming to identify patterns, trends, and correlations in match outcomes, player statistics, or team performance.
## Tools Used For Analysis
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pyhton
- Libraries : Pandas, Numpy
## Key takeaways
- The EuroCup tournament featured 16 participating teams.
- The dataset consisted of 35 columns containing match-related information.
- A new dataframe named "discipline" was created, specifically including the columns for Team, Yellow Cards, and Red Cards.
- Teams like Denmark, Germany, England, Netherlands, and Ukraine demonstrated good discipline by not receiving any red cards.
- The mean number of yellow cards per team was calculated to be 7.4375, providing an average measure of aggression or fouls committed.
- Germany and Spain were identified as high-scoring teams, scoring more than 6 goals in the tournament.
- Germany and Greece were the teams whose names started with the letter "G."
- The first 7 columns of the dataset provided insights into team names, goals scored, shooting accuracy, and total shots.
- All columns, except the last 3, offered a comprehensive set of attributes for further analysis of team performance.
- England had the highest shooting accuracy at 50.0%, followed by Italy at 43.0%, and Russia at 22.5%
